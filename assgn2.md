# CS2005 F22 Assignment 2

by E. Brown, 2022

This is an individual assignment. Submit an original solution.

Complete the implementation of the Molecule class in the molecule.py module.

A partial implementation of the module is provided in the github classroom repository.

Internal documentation in the module file should be sufficient for you to determine the expected behaviour of the Molecule class.  You will need to modify or implement the following methods:

* `atoms` (complete the stub)
* `check_symbols` (fix a bug)
* `clean_copy` (complete the stub)
* `__iter__` (override the inherited iterator) 

You may change the module implementation using any standard python3.10 libraries.

A unittest class will be used to score your submission. You will receive 1 point for each test above 6 that your solution passes, to a maximum of 12 points.  Thirteen of 18 tests are provided in the repository along with the partial implementation.

You will be penalized for pylint warnings in your code submission, with the exception of refactor warnings, which will not be penalized. 

Do not change the class attribute names or the test cases will no longer run.

Be sure to include an attributions section in your Molecular.py docstring.

### Submission instructions:

Push your solution to your GitHub Classroom assignment2 repository before the deadline.
