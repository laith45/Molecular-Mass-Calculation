<h1 id="cs2005-f22-assignment-2">CS2005 F22 Assignment 2</h1>
<p>by E. Brown, 2022</p>
<p>This is an individual assignment. Submit an original solution.</p>
<p>Complete the implementation of the Molecule class in the molecule.py module.</p>
<p>A partial implementation of the module is provided in the github classroom repository.</p>
<p>Internal documentation in the module file should be sufficient for you to determine the expected behaviour of the Molecule class. You will need to modify or implement the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>atoms</code> (complete the stub)</li>
<li><code>check_symbols</code> (fix a bug)</li>
<li><code>clean_copy</code> (complete the stub)</li>
<li><code>__iter__</code> (override the inherited iterator)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may change the module implementation using any standard python3.10 libraries.</p>
<p>A unittest class will be used to score your submission. You will receive 1 point for each test above 6 that your solution passes, to a maximum of 12 points. Thirteen of 18 tests are provided in the repository along with the partial implementation.</p>
<p>You will be penalized for pylint warnings in your code submission, with the exception of refactor warnings, which will not be penalized.</p>
<p>Do not change the class attribute names or the test cases will no longer run.</p>
